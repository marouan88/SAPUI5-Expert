# @sapui5/ts-types

This npm package contains the types signatures (based on globals) for all the SAPUI5 libraries.

These signatures can be used to:

1. Enable advanced content assist in IDEs, e.g: (VSCode / IntelliJ / Webstorm) for SAPUI5.
1. Integrate type checking for SAPUI5 applications using the TypeScript compiler.

These two capabilities are available both for SAPUI5 apps written in TypeScript **and** in JavaScript.

<b>NOTE:</b> "based on globals" means that it supports the usage of the global "sap" object and the huge tree below this global object containing all modules and controls. But this usage is <b>no longer recommended</b>. In traditional JavaScript, UI5 application code should use the asynchronous sap.ui.define()/sap.ui.require() calls instead and for TypeScript code we recommend using ES6 module syntax provided by the [@sapui5/ts-types-esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapui5/ts-types-esm) package. So better use that one instead of this package.
